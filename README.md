# Hi there 👋, I'm Tristan S.

## 👨‍💻 About Me
I'm a **software developer in training** (1st year of my apprenticeship) from Germany 🇩🇪.  
I have a strong passion for **programming, problem-solving, and system design**. My main goal is to understand **everything I program in detail** – not just to make it work, but to know *why* it works.
